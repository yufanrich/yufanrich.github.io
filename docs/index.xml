3 对标与模仿:找到一个新人,但是有一定粉丝或文章 # 比如:做抖音:找一个小号,跟你类似的,模仿对比。
比如:做公众号:找一个也是刚刚开始做的公众号,一起前行。
比如:学习、考试:找一个差不多实力,但是综合排名比你好。 结合自身优势与劣势、分析对比、逐步提高。
小白尤其要注意,不要一开始就好高骛远，直接对比行业大拿，首先他们背后可能是一个团队， 你跟不上他们的速度与资源，会打击自信心。 即:允许自己一次次提升一名，而不是一次提升到第一名。
4 工欲善其事,必先利其器 # 科技是第一生产力，永远为自己思考一条高效的符合自己习惯的学习之路。
比如:一些笔记能截图就截图、能打印就打印，不要手抄。
比如:公众号的排版问题,有工具用工具
个人公众号工具
5 身体是革命的本钱 # 坚持运动、坚持早睡早起。你会发现整个人的精神状态是不一样的。
6 正确调节内心 # 允许自己懒惰,但是请务必不要忘记拯救自己

时常感觉能量耗尽怎么办
1 维护自己的能量，防止陷入自我内耗 （给自己的成长留时间，给错误的改正留时间，摒弃开口要，闭口得到的巨婴思维） 摒弃儿童/巨婴思维（开口要，闭口得到），转换为耕耘思维，过程思维，长期主义思维， 重过程而不重结果，尽人事听天命。（尽人事，听天命。对于个人而言，更重要的是尽人事） 避免因为某个特殊场景的失败，而让自己陷入着急、焦虑于悲观。 即不要玻璃心,受不了批评。小孩子就是不能批评。 不要抱怨和推卸责任，不要以自我为中心，不要总觉得自己的想法或方案是最好的。要允许其他人的优秀。 更重要的是不要什么东西或事情都想要开口要，闭口就要得到。得不到就委屈、愤怒、焦虑等。 要意识到花开也是需要选种、播种、施肥、除草，成长、开花、结果、收获。一步步去做，去实现，需要时间和过程。 2 细微处提升自己的能量，激励自己战胜更大困难 生活如此多艰，你需要主动给自己加点料。这个料就是自我设置一个小胜利， 从而激励自己战胜更大的困难。这个料可以是一个旅游，一场电影，一杯奶茶，一顿自己做的饭。 总之，设置这个任务的时候，我就已经看到了胜利。 3 于想到时,使用自己的能量，避免完美主义的陷阱 先静之，再思之，五六分把握即做之-《曾国藩家书》。 有时候我们往往花在学习上的准备时间超过了真正学习的时间。比如纠结学习工具、学习状态、学习方法， 但是就像再顺手的中性笔，没有头脑中足够的积淀，也很难写出文采斐然的文章。 但是一个7分的学习方法搭配努力，已经足够达到10分的学习效果。遵循28原则吧，更多的是学习本身。 就像求职一样，想着准备好所有的考点再去投递简历，往往错过了时机。 而且你也永远不可能完全的去准备。五六分把握即做之。 记住:比完美更重要的是开始。未来会在你的行动下，清晰并触手可及。 如何进步 # 小富即安: 1-100(努力) 书读百遍,其义自现。 # 不断对标选手，超越选手，慢慢摸索出一条道路。</description></item><item><title/><link>https://yufanrich.github.io/docs/test/1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan

于是希望找到一个平替的插件。(小惊喜:这款翻译插件同时也支持图片文字识别及提取👍👍👍) ps:如果是ie浏览器或者safari浏览器,一般都默认自带中英文翻译,也挺好使用。 如果不是自己的电脑,偶尔使用,默认浏览器即可。小猿还是喜欢使用谷歌浏览器,所以使用平替插件。
安装流程 # 2.1 访问官网下载安装包 # 官网地址:https://magicfanyi.youdao.com/#/
软件简介 安装步奏
下载zip安装包、解压 访问谷歌浏览器扩展程序:chrome://extensions/ 加载已解压的扩展程序即可 安装完成 2.2 效果演示 # 测试网站:https://dictionary.cambridge.org/
2.3 使用习惯调优 # 2.4 值得一提的是:大模型翻译 # 虽然大模型现在是实验性质,但是随着模型的优化,感觉未来可期。 2.5 图片识别 # 图片里面文字提取,这也是一个意外惊喜,有时候需要提取图片的文字,没想到翻译软件也集成了，不错不错。 总结 # 工欲善其事，必先利其器。总体而言，这种翻译插件还是不错的，有需要的小伙伴可以使用起来。</description></item></channel></rss>
